        <h1>Robby Tv</h1>
        <p>My name is <em>robin sharma</em> .I'm purusuing my Engineering from chitkara university in Electronics And Communication Department.A video editor uses digital software to organise it and sound files into a final product. I have experience working with creative software like iMovie, Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro. I have edited for than 200 videos.
        I will meet my clients requirements and create a video he is looking for. 
        Video Editors are generally responsible for editing and assembling recorded raw material into a suitable, finished product ready for broadcasting.
        I have a good experience regarding  Editing, applying green/blue screen effects to the videos, improving sound quality, colours, adding background music.
        I ensure the correct formatting and presentation for finalised videos according to client's specification.
        I will charge less from my clients and do their work on time.
        Thank You,
        Robin
